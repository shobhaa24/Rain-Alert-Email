# Rain-Alert-Email

We extracted the data from "https://openweathermap.org/" using API about the weather conditions in any place you like. You need to have the latitude and longitude values of that place which can be easily found out by going to "https://www.latlong.net" and api_key.

If there's a chance of rain in the next 12 hours, we send a mail to the desired person living in that area to carry an umbrella.
